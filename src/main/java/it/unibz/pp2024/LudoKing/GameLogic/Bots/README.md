# Bot Class
## Scope of this class
In theory, this class should contain the features of the Bots, such as the one of a normal player. We could add a choice at the beginning of the game which allows the player to choose how many bots will play the game (If it is not too hard). 
The bots will have random functions, so the PC controls them. The bots won't do the mini-games (due to an artificial intelligence problem).

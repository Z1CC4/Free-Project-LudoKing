    Points:
    - Player with highest points win, point are gained either wins the minigames or depends on the placement,
    for example the player who has all his token in the base will gain more points than the other one who are going
    or to place their token after. Idea: you gain points also if you eat other player's token.
    - A player lose points if his token is eaten
    - Every minigame has different winning points, depending on the difficulty of the game
    - Methods for points: addPoints, losePoints, listPoints, historyPoints.
    Movement:
    - If you roll a six, you roll again
    - You can't go back, apart from if you're token gets eaten.
    Bot:
    - The bot has a simplified version of the minigame (true or false minigame), it will randomly generate true or false
    - All the functions are random
    - It will not gain perks

## Project Description

This project is a recreation of the fameous board game "Ludo King" (in Italian: "Non t'arrabbiare"), with more interesting features.

## Building and Running the Project


## User Guide

Every player has 4 token and the goal of each player is to get all of them in the home. In order to take out a token the player must roll a six with the die. If there is at least outside and the there any token in the base, if you roll a six you can decide either to move or to take out a token. During the progression of the game it is possible to enocuter some tiles with a minigame in it. The player, in order to gain points and perks, has to win it. In case of victory the player will gain points and a perk. In case the player has already reiceved a specific perk, he cannot gain another of the same type. In addition, if the player wins, his token will move one position ahead. On the contrary he will go one position backwards. It is possible. In both cases of win or lose, it is possible to encounter another minigame. As the original game, the eat mechanism is implemented. The eat mechanism works based on the position on the map (which is when a token is taken out from the base, it will be placed in a random position on the map). The player who got the token eaten will lose points, which will be gained by the other player who ate it. On our versione of the game, the winner will not be the one who got all the tokens in the hom. Instead, it will be the one who gained more points.

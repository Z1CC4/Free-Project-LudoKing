Project Description
This project is a recreation of the famous board game "Ludo King" (in Italian: "Non t'arrabbiare"), with additional interesting features.

Building and Running the Project
(Instructions on building and running the project should go here.)

User Guide
Each player has 4 tokens, and the goal is to get all of them to the home. To move a token out of the base, the player must roll a six on the die. If there is already at least one token outside the base and a player rolls a six, they can choose either to move a token or to bring out another token.

During the game, players might encounter tiles with a minigame. To gain points and perks, the player must win the minigame. If the player wins, they earn points and a perk. However, if the player already has a specific perk, they cannot earn the same one again. Additionally, if the player wins, their token moves one position ahead. Conversely, if they lose, their token moves one position backward. In both cases, it is possible to encounter another minigame.

As in the original game, the "eat" mechanism is implemented. This mechanism is based on the position on the board (when a token is taken out of the base, it is placed in a random position on the board). The player whose token is eaten loses points, which are gained by the player who performed the "eat." In our version of the game, the winner is not the player who gets all their tokens home first, but the one who accumulates the most points.
